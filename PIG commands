LOAD
	This operator is used to load a file from a local system to a pig grunt shell.
	example: A = LOAD '/home/acadgild/Student.txt' AS (id:int,age:int);
	here in A a file Student.txt will be stored having two fields id and age.
	
	STORE
	When we need to store certain file from pig grunt shell to a local file system we used store command.
	example: STORE A INTO 'outputfile' USING PigStorage('*');
	this will store all the tuples of A in outputfile by seperating it with *.
	later the file can be printed using CAT outputfile.
	
	DUMP
	To display all the tuples present in a file we use the DUMP command.
	Example A has multiple tuples then to view the tuples we give: DUMP A;
	
	FOREACH
	FOREACH is used to execute certain operation on all the tuples of a dataset.
	It generates data transformation based on ceratin condition of data.
	it is written as:
	X = FOREACH A GENERATE id*1000;
	
	FILTER
	It is used to select set of tuple based on certain condition.
	A:
	(1,2,8)
	(4,2,1)
	(4,3,8)
	
	X = FILTER A BY f3==8;
	
	then this will give:
	X:(1,2,8)
	(4,3,8)
	
	GROUP BY
	To group certain fields based on certain criterion group condition is used.
	example:
	X = GROUP A BY age;
	this will group all the tuples according to their ages.
	
	ORDER BY
	This is used to sort the tuples based on asc or desc values of that field.
	
	example: X = ORDER A BY A3 DESC;
	
	DESCRIBE
	To get the schema we use describe oprator;
	using DUMP we can simply get the tuples whereas using DESCRIBE we get the data types of all the fields,
	
	A:(1,xyz,8);
	
	DESCRIBE A;
	This will give A:{id:int,name:chararray,value:int}
